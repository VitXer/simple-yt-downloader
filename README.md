Hello. This is my first program.
It's a program with graphical interface that allows you to download videos from YouTube and convert them to desired format.

Code is so simple I don't think it needs explaining
I use Tkinter to make windows.
I use yt-dlp to download videos.
I use ffmpeg to convert videos.

launch instructions:
Download ffmpeg and add ffmpeg.exe to PATH.
Download yt-dl.
Launch main.py with python.

Tested in python 3.11 on Windows 10
